## Settings Styling

## Dark Theme Implementation

## Language Translation Coverage
- [ ] Update LandingPage.jsx to use useTranslation for all hardcoded text
- [ ] Review other components (Login.jsx, etc.) for consistent translation usage
- [ ] Ensure all user-facing text is translated across the website

## Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test theme switching functionality (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Test language switching functionality (en, es, fr, sw)
- [ ] Verify styles apply correctly in both themes
- [ ] Confirm translations work across all components
