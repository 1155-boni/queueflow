- [x] Update join_queue in views.py to check for any active queue entry (joined, waiting, called) to prevent multiple joins.
- [x] Update my_queue_position in views.py to include 'joined' status so users can see their queue immediately after joining.
- [x] Update leave_queue in views.py to include 'joined' status so users can leave immediately after joining.
